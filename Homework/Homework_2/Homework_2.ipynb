Report the optimal step length and point found ALONG $p$ (i.e. report both \"$\\alpha$\" and $x_{(k=1)} = x_{(k=0)} + \\alpha^*p$) and the number of function calls required to obtain $x_{(k=1)}$. (Remember this isn't the flobal minimum, just the minimum along the current $p$ direction.) It is important to note that the values you choose for $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$, $\\alpha$, and the interpolation method will affect the outcome of the line search. For consistency with the answer key, use $\\mu_1 = 1e-4$, $\\mu_2 = 0.1$, $\\alpha = 2.0$ for the inputs to the bracketing function, and use the cubic interpolation scheme within the pinpoint function. This interpolation scheme can be found at the end of section 4.3 in the textbook. Do not normalize $p$. Discuss what you learned with these tests in 200 words or less.  \n",
